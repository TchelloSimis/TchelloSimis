- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TchelloSimis
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in trading, cryptocurrencies, and mathematics. The main reason for me to create this GitHub is that TradingView mods suck and they've hidden my scripts for no reason whatsoever. Since my personal ethics are toa lways do everything free and open-source, I'll start sharing my scripts here in addition to trying to get them to stick in the TV indicators tab.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a good teacher! 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me very easily on Discord! My username is Tchello#2288
